# Project_BiasFreeResumeScreening
In this project, I aim to screen the resumes based on the similarity between the skills mentioned and the job description. However, there could be bias during screening due to conscious or unconscious biases concerning sensitive features like sex, age, ethnicity, etc. In this project, I aim to detect and reduce these biases to make a fair model.
